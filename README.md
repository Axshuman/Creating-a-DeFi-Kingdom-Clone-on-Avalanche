# Creating-a-DeFi-Kingdom-Clone-on-Avalanche

## Overview:
DeFi Kingdoms is a decentralized finance (DeFi) game where players can battle, explore, and trade using native currency.

## Setup Instructions:
1. Setting Up EVM Subnet on Avalanche Network
2. Defining Native Currency
3. Connecting to Metamask
4. Deploying Basic Building Blocks

## Setting Up EVM Subnet on Avalanche Network:
- Follow the provided guide and Avalanche documentation to set up a custom EVM subnet on Avalanche network.

## Defining Native Currency:
- Define native currency parameters such as name, symbol, etc.
- Implement as an ERC20 token using Solidity.
- Deploy ERC20 token contract on the EVM subnet.

## Connecting to Metamask:
- Install Metamask extension in your browser.
- Configure Metamask to connect to custom EVM subnet.

## Deploying Basic Building Blocks:
- Write Solidity smart contracts for game mechanics.
- Test contracts locally using Remix IDE.
- Deploy contracts on EVM subnet.
